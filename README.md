# TornadoFX Samples

Here you will find samples showcasing best practises with [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx). For now it contains a fictive CRM application,
inspired by the CRM example app from the [DHTMLX](http://dhtmlx.com/) framework.

The example also integrates controls from the [TornadoFX Controls](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-controls) project.

The example contains contact data and images from https://randomuser.me. The generated JSON was then stripped for
unneeded fields, but no data was changed. The example data is copyrighted under the

and we'll make sure to add an example for you :)
